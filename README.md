"Listed on the Heroku reference page, the supported buildpacks offered are: Ruby, Node.js, Clojure, Python, Java, Gradle, Grails, Scala, Play, PHP, Go. These buildpacks are searched within the deployed repo based on the specified language used. However, the buildpacks are not offered for the typical HTML, CSS, Javascript languages. This explains the error you received: “no default language could be detected for this app”.
Don’t worry, it’s an easy fix for your portfolio or personal blog. A small little trick to get Heroku to recognize the files of your static website is to trick it into being a PHP app. Yup, PHP."
